## Gobal Hourly Data

[global hourly data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/) contains data in an hourly format.  There are 3 directories here:

- access
Has data to be downloaded
- archives
I think this is each years data compressed
- docs
Some docs that are hard to read

## Notes
Information in this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22104133/2426822) is useful even though the links are out of date.  Need to look further into [pydap](http://pydap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
